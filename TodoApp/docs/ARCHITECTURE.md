# Todo App Architecture

## System Overview
The application is structured as a layered system with a custom database implementation.

## Core Components

### 1. Memory Management Layer
- Dynamic allocation system
- Memory pools for todo items
- Cleanup and garbage collection
- Memory safety protocols

### 2. Data Structures
- Todo items
- Dynamic arrays
- Index structures
- Memory blocks

### 3. Custom Database Engine
#### Storage Engine
- File-based storage
- Page-based memory management
- B-tree indexing
- Transaction log

#### Query Engine
- CRUD operations
- Search capabilities
- Sorting mechanisms
- Index utilization

### 4. Persistence Layer
- File I/O operations
- Data serialization
- Transaction management
- ACID compliance

## Data Flow
1. User Input → Memory Management
2. Memory Management → Data Structures
3. Data Structures → Storage Engine
4. Storage Engine → Persistence Layer

## Performance Considerations
- Memory allocation strategies
- Cache utilization
- Index optimization
- Concurrent access patterns

## Error Handling
- Memory allocation failures
- I/O errors
- Data corruption prevention
- Transaction rollbacks

## Future Considerations
- Multi-user support
- Network layer
- Replication
- Advanced querying capabilities

## Dependencies
- Standard library only
- Custom implementations for all major components

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for data flow
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory leak detection
