# Project Progress Log

## Latest Updates
- [2024-03] ✅ Successfully implemented dynamic memory allocation
- [2024-03] ✅ Completed basic CRUD operations with error handling
- [2024-03] ✅ Implemented file I/O with error handling
- [2024-03] ✅ Implemented shift-based deletion
- [2024-03] ✅ Added proper memory management

## Current Status
- Working on: String handling in file I/O
- Completed: Basic CRUD operations
- Next: Memory optimization
- Focus: File data parsing and memory management

## Technical Achievements
1. Memory Management
   - ✅ Dynamic array implementation with allocator
   - ✅ Proper memory allocation/deallocation
   - ✅ Growth functionality (1.5x growth factor)
   - ✅ Shrink functionality (half capacity)
   - ✅ Memory safety checks

2. Error Handling
   - ✅ Todo operation errors (ArrayFull, InvalidIndex, etc.)
   - ✅ File operation error handling
   - ✅ Memory operation error handling
   - ✅ State validation checks

3. Data Operations
   - ✅ Add todo with dynamic growth
   - ✅ Shift-based deletion
   - ✅ Toggle completion status
   - ✅ File persistence (save/load)
   - ✅ Priority handling

## Next Steps (Based on PLAN.md)
1. Phase 1 Completion
   - [ ] Memory cleanup protocols
   - [ ] Memory optimization
   - [ ] Error handling refinement

2. Phase 2 Implementation
   - [ ] Search functionality
   - [ ] Sorting algorithms
   - [ ] Indexing system
   - [ ] Memory optimization

3. Testing Framework
   - [ ] Unit test setup (as per justfile)
   - [ ] Memory leak detection
   - [ ] Performance benchmarking
   - [ ] Edge case testing

## Future Considerations
- Database-like query capabilities
- Advanced memory management patterns
- Concurrent operations support
- Extended data validation
